CONSIDERATION:

PAIRING MODE
- We assume that the first device of the couple is always the parent bracelet and the second one is the child
  (
	e.g. we have N bracelets with id=1,2,3,4
	If we're considering the couple of devices (1,2): 1->parent and 2->child
	If we're considering the couple of devices (3,4): 3->parent and 4->child
  )
